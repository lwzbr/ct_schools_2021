# CT School District Rankings

This is an upload of a data analysis project I had done in 2021 as part of my research assistantship for the New Milford Long Term Recovery Committee. Our goal had been to compile statistics on the best-rated school districts in Connecticut and their demographics, in order to contextualize the performance of New Milford Public Schools.

I originally did this in R but since rewrote it in Python using Pandas in a Jupyter notebook.

Our work was published in the [Committee's report](https://www.newmilford.org/filestorage/7526/35379/40533/Long_Term_Recovery_LTRC_Plan_and_Report_12_March_21_FINAL_%281%29.pdf) (PDF page 126).
